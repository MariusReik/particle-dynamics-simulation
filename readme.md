# Particle Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates particle motion in a two-dimensional system and analyzes trajectory crossings at specific points. It was created to help with a math project for my sister at **NTNU**.

## Features
- Solves differential equations for particle motion.
- Detects crossings
- Visualizes the relationship between initial conditions and crossings.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python trajectory_crossing.py
   python particle_simuation.py
   ```
